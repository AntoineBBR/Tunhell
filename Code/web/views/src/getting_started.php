                            <p class="m-4">Tunhell is a card game in the medieval fantasy universe which consists of managing a team of dwarves to mine and harvest wealth.
                            The game is played with 4 players for an average duration of 30 minutes. Each player receives in his starting hand 4 cards which can be miners, warriors, explorers as well as “deminers”.</p>
                        <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-purple-400">2. Procedure</h2>
                            <p class="m-4">
                            On the board, 3 decks of cards are placed in the center and represent the mines to be to explore. A player can draw a certain number of cards (as many as mining points that he will have put on the mine) only if he is in numerical superiority in terms of points of combat (points held by the warriors).<br> As soon as a card is placed the player must choose among 5 cards that supply a manpower pool. Some cards have must be placed directly and cannot go into the player's hand. The mines are full of resources, various monsters, and land to evacuate before to arrive at the end of mine gate.<br> In the event of a confrontation with a monster, if the player has enough warriors powerful to defeat them, he will keep his numbers (miners and warriors) and keep the map number of monsters for the wealth count at the end of the game.<br> Otherwise, the numbers of his choice will be discarded.<br> Also, monsters have several classes representing a certain number of wealth points. In case the player finds neither monster nor wealth, he will come across a card of ground which is not without affecting the final score.<br> Indeed several trophies exist: 
                            <br><br>• The trophy for the best miner and given each round to the player with the most cards ground or to the last equalizing the latter.
                            <br><br>• The "rat hunter" trophy is given to the player who has killed the most monsters of the "rat" class enemies very common within the mines.
                            <br><br>The last card of a mine is an end of mine card which is random, it hides a powerful monster or a curse (a player can lose all his wealth, (…)). When 2 mines are completely empty, the points are counted
                            </p>
